## My process

1. First thing I did was to take a look at the given image and come up with the structure. 
I broke down the whole card component (in my head) into a group of divs, figured out how I would use 
flexbox to align them to look like the given design.

2. I wrote the HTML, setting up the divs like I had in my head. I also added images where they were needed. 
After doing this, I created a commit and pushed it to the remote repository.

3. After this, I came up with ideas for class names and then began styling. I first styled the body element, 
grabbing the font stylesheet values from Google fonts. After this, I got to work from top to bottom, styling 
each element and ensuring to get it right till I got to the bottom. 
After doing this I created a commit and pushed it to the remote repository.

4. What I did next was to then style the hover states of the active elements. I then created this README,
then a commit and pushed it to the remote repository.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

My BIG learning in this project is that GRIT is MAJOR KEY. I hit a roadblock when trying to layout the
annual-plan-cost class and I almost decided to go sleep but then I took a short break, came back and was
able to figure it out.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to give a shout out to Mozilla and Google for creating the Mozilla Developer network and creating a platform
where I could find answers when I got stuck. Between both of them, it seems most of my coding problems are always
gonna get solved.
